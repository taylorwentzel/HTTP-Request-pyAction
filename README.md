# Python Container HTTP Request Action

This is currently a work in progress. `main.py` contains code that will send an http post request [here](https://ghatracker.herokuapp.com/).  This web app displays who uses this action and when.

## Current State
This action is currently in the prototyping stage. For now, information sent to the web app is defined in main.py.  The hope is for future functionality to allow for user information to be passed into main.py from the original workflow using this action.
